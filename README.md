The code needs some polishing, and is not 100% complete. Lacks image handling for example. The main logic is there.
The documentation could also be improved, but I just don't have enough time right now to make it pretty. The config handling should be better also.

What's in: 
* Display list of available sources 
* Retrieve articles
  * Select sources
  * Select categories (category A OR category B)
  * Start from a selected timestamp
  * Articles are sorted from the latest one to the oldest one
* Example postman collection 
* Swagger API definition
